# 🧪 Interruption Testing Guide

## 🎯 How to Test Interruption Properly

### **The Issue**
Your logs show `isGenerating: false` - this means Laura isn't currently speaking when you're talking, so there's nothing to interrupt.

### **✅ Correct Testing Steps**

1. **Start a call** to your system
2. **Wait for Laura to start speaking** (you should see `🎵 FIRST AUDIO DELTA`)
3. **While Laura is speaking**, interrupt by talking
4. **Look for these logs**:
   ```
   🎵 INCOMING AUDIO DURING AI RESPONSE: { ... }
   🚨 MANUAL INTERRUPTION TRIGGER - Incoming audio during AI response
   🔄 SENDING TWILIO CLEAR (manual): { ... }
   🛑 SENDING OPENAI CANCEL (manual): { ... }
   ```

### **❌ What You're Currently Doing**
- Talking when Laura isn't speaking
- This triggers `🔍 AUDIO PACKET DEBUG` with `isGenerating: false`
- No interruption occurs because there's nothing to interrupt

### **🔍 Key Logs to Watch For**

#### **When Laura Starts Speaking:**
```
🎵 FIRST AUDIO DELTA: { turnId: X, ttfb: XXX, timestamp: XXX }
```

#### **When You Interrupt (Should See):**
```
🎵 INCOMING AUDIO DURING AI RESPONSE: { turnId: X, isGenerating: true }
🚨 MANUAL INTERRUPTION TRIGGER - Incoming audio during AI response
```

#### **When You Talk But Laura Isn't Speaking (Current Issue):**
```
🔍 AUDIO PACKET DEBUG: { isGenerating: false, status: 'NO_ACTIVE_TURN' }
```

### **📱 Testing Script**

Run this to monitor logs in real-time:
```bash
./monitor_logs.sh
```

### **🎯 Success Criteria**

- **Fast interruption**: < 500ms from speech to clear confirmation
- **Successful cancellation**: Response status should be 'cancelled'
- **Immediate audio stop**: Twilio buffer should clear quickly

### **🚨 Common Issues**

1. **Talking too early**: Wait for Laura to start speaking first
2. **Talking too late**: Laura might have already finished
3. **Network delay**: Commands take time to reach services
4. **Audio buffering**: Audio already in pipeline when cancel sent
